# Ouroboros Vision

Ouroboros challenges the centralized AI paradigm by enabling distributed inference across forgotten, mismatched, and discarded hardware.

## Philosophy

- **Reuse over Replace**: Every device has latent value.
- **Decentralization by Default**: Intelligence should not be locked in clouds.
- **Trust as a Primitive**: Reliability is earned, not assumed.
- **Hardware Agnosticism**: No vendor lock-in, no architecture bias.

## Long-Term Goal

To become the "Linux of distributed AI inference" — a neutral, open, and extensible foundation for edge-native intelligence.
